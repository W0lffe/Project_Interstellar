# Codename: Project_Interstellar

## State of Project

The game has been successfully converted to run with a JavaFX GUI and is now playable up to a certain point. 
It features functional core mechanics such as combat, skill checks, inventory management, and progress tracking. 
Players can explore varied environments, engage with characters, and make impactful choices that shape their journey as the story unfolds. 



As this is a work in progress, certain features are still being developed, and the game may contain bugs or issues. 
Updates will continue as new content and features are added, with an ongoing focus on polishing gameplay and expanding the storyline.

#### Run the game

In Visual Studio Code:
* Run task using tasks.json tasks, Compile -> Build JAR -> Run JAR

Executable file coming soon!

## Brief:
#### Objective:
Develop a text-based adventure game to explore and practice programming techniques, with an emphasis on object-oriented principles and object manipulation. 
The game's story, crafted in collaboration with AI, unfolds in a sci-fi setting, allowing the player to make choices, interact with characters, and explore different environments.

#### Scope and Functionality:
This project will involve creating and manipulating various game objects, such as characters, items, and locations, to simulate a dynamic and immersive experience. 
Game functionality is intentionally flexible to accommodate ongoing learning and new programming concepts. 
The project will be iteratively refined as new skills are developed, with the potential to add or adjust features based on learning needs.
