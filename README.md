# Codename: Project_Interstellar

## State of Project

The game is currently playable up to a certain point, featuring functional core mechanics such as combat, skill checks, inventory management, and progress tracking. 
The story is actively unfolding, and players can explore a variety of environments, interact with characters, and make choices that shape their journey.

As this is a work in progress, certain features are still being developed, and the game may contain bugs or issues. 
Updates will continue as new content and features are added, with an ongoing focus on polishing gameplay and expanding the storyline.

## Brief:
#### Objective:
Develop a text-based adventure game to explore and practice programming techniques, with an emphasis on object-oriented principles and object manipulation. 
The game's story, crafted in collaboration with AI, unfolds in a sci-fi setting, allowing the player to make choices, interact with characters, and explore different environments.

#### Scope and Functionality:
This project will involve creating and manipulating various game objects, such as characters, items, and locations, to simulate a dynamic and immersive experience. 
Game functionality is intentionally flexible to accommodate ongoing learning and new programming concepts. 
The project will be iteratively refined as new skills are developed, with the potential to add or adjust features based on learning needs.
