# Codename: Project_Interstellar

## State of Project

The current JavaFX version of the project is not yet playable, as a few core mechanics are still under development. 
While some mechanics have undergone minor adjustments, the overall design and functionality remain consistent with the original vision. 
I am actively refining and honing these mechanics to ensure a smooth and engaging experience once the project becomes playable.

As this is a work in progress, certain features are still being developed, and the game may contain bugs or issues. 
Updates will continue as new content and features are added, with an ongoing focus on polishing gameplay and expanding the storyline.

To run the game in terminal (from project folder):

compile: 
```
javac src/*.java -d out
```
run:
```
java -cp out/ Main
```

or

In Visual Studio Code:
* Run task using tasks.json tasks, Compile -> Build JAR -> Run JAR


## Brief:
#### Objective:
Develop a text-based adventure game to explore and practice programming techniques, with an emphasis on object-oriented principles and object manipulation. 
The game's story, crafted in collaboration with AI, unfolds in a sci-fi setting, allowing the player to make choices, interact with characters, and explore different environments.

#### Scope and Functionality:
This project will involve creating and manipulating various game objects, such as characters, items, and locations, to simulate a dynamic and immersive experience. 
Game functionality is intentionally flexible to accommodate ongoing learning and new programming concepts. 
The project will be iteratively refined as new skills are developed, with the potential to add or adjust features based on learning needs.
