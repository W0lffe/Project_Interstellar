CAVE1

Jaxon starts along the trail to the north, the ground beneath him shifting from soft earth to rough stone as he climbs. 
The air grows cooler, carrying the faint scent of moss and damp earth. 
Tall trees begin to thin out, and the sound of rustling leaves fades, replaced by an almost eerie silence.

Ahead, a rocky outcrop rises from the ground, partially hidden by thick patches of ferns and wild plants. 
As Jaxon rounds a final bend, he spots the mouth of a cave, dark and yawning, set into the hillside. 
Its edges are framed by jagged stones, casting deep shadows against the rock. 
The air here feels heavier, colder, and the faint echo of dripping water filters out from the depths of the cave.

Jaxon pauses at the entrance, eyes adjusting to the dimness within, as he considers what might await him inside.



Jaxon steps deeper into the cave, the air growing thick and suffocating.
A foul, rotting stench fills his nostrils, and an eerie silence presses in around him. 
His senses are heightened as the sound of low growls and skittering echoes off the damp stone walls. 
He pauses, trying to locate the source, but the darkness conceals everything.

Then, a shift in the shadows catches his eye. From the depths of the caverns, something stirs—huge shapes moving with predatory grace. 
At first, Jaxon thinks it's just his mind playing tricks on him, but then the creatures step into the dim light, revealing their full, horrifying form.

These are not the skitters he’s fought before. 
These beasts are much larger—towering figures with dark, spiny exoskeletons. 
Their legs are thick and segmented, built for power and speed. Long, sharp claws scrape against the cave floor as they move with unsettling fluidity. 
Their heads are covered in jagged plates, and rows of glowing, malevolent eyes watch Jaxon with calculating intelligence.

From the deep caverns, more of these creatures emerge, their growls resonating through the cave. 
Their long, spiked tails whip through the air, ready to strike at anything that dares to come close. 
These aren’t mindless predators—they're a coordinated pack, working together, and Jaxon realizes he’s not just in a cave, but in their nest.

CAVE2

Jaxon steps carefully over the remains of the defeated Fangdwellers, his senses heightened, the air growing colder and more oppressive as he ventures deeper into the cave. 
The faint growls and skittering of the smaller creatures fade into an eerie silence, only to be replaced by a low, guttural rumble.

He freezes, straining his ears. The growl comes again, louder this time, echoing off the jagged walls of the cavern. 
Something much larger than the creatures he's already fought lurks ahead.

Around the corner, the tunnel widens, opening into a massive, dark hall. The shadows seem to grow thicker here, and Jaxon instinctively tightens his grip on his weapon. 
His heart races as the air grows colder still, the stench of decay and rot much stronger now.

Suddenly, from the darkness, a hulking shape emerges—its eyes glinting with malice. A massive Fangdweller, much larger than any Jaxon has faced so far.
Its skin is mottled with scars, and its jagged teeth gleam in the dim light. Its growl rumbles through the cavern, shaking the walls. 
The Alpha Fangdweller steps forward, its gaze locking onto Jaxon with an intensity that sends a chill down his spine.

This creature is different—more intelligent, more dangerous. 
It stands as a terrifying symbol of dominance in this dark, forsaken place. Jaxon knows that defeating this beast will be no simple task.

Jaxon’s eyes flick to the far corner of the cavern, where a lifeless body lies against the rocks, a datapad blinking faintly beside it. 
The body, clad in tattered armor, has clearly been here for some time.

Jaxon: "I wonder what’s on that datapad…"

The creature growls low, its massive form blocking the path to the corpse.

Jaxon: "Maybe I could sneak past it.."
