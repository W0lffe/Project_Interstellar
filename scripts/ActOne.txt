ACT1-SCENE1

Jaxon and Teth emerge from lightspeed with a sudden, brilliant flash, their ship hurtling through the vastness of space toward Calyra Drift. 
The planet Calyra I looms in the distance, a lush, deep-green orb floating against the backdrop of stars. But before they can catch their breath, the ship’s sensors beep an alert—hostile signatures are detected. 
A small Ra'kra fleet hovers in the sector, like silent sentinels, waiting.

From the corner of the viewport, Jaxon spots the battleship: a dark, angular behemoth cutting through space, its jagged hull illuminated by the glint of distant stars. 
It’s flanked by several smaller vessels, each primed and ready to engage. 
In an instant, the fighters break formation and dart toward them, sleek and menacing, weapons glowing a threatening red.

Jaxon grips the controls, his voice tense.
Jaxon: "Hang on, Teth. Looks like they’re not letting anyone through."

Teth, already in position at the cannon, readies the weapons.
Teth: "Let’s give them a warm welcome."

The ship jolts as Jaxon pulls into an evasive spiral, weaving between the oncoming fighters. 
Teth takes aim, firing precise bursts as enemy ships streak past them. 
The cockpit is alive with flashing indicators and alarms, the low hum of the engines punctuated by the explosive thud of the cannon.

One Ra'kra fighter explodes under Teth's steady aim, leaving a trail of debris in its wake. 
Another follows, disintegrating into fiery fragments that spin away into the void. 
But there are too many of them, and the battleship holds its position like a fortress, casting a dark shadow over Calyra I.

A sudden impact rocks the ship. Warning lights flash across the control panel, and a plume of smoke fills the cabin. 
Systems begin to fail one by one, and the smell of scorched metal fills the air.

Jaxon curses, frantically maneuvering the controls.
Jaxon: "Brace yourself—we’re going down!"

With the Ra'kra fighters pulling back, their job done, Jaxon and Teth’s ship spirals toward the planet below, caught in the unforgiving pull of Calyra I’s gravity. 
The descent is violent, the cockpit trembling with the force of entry. 
They plummet through layers of thick clouds, which momentarily cloak the view of the ground below.

As they break through the cloud cover, the landscape of Calyra I unfolds beneath them—a stunning world of dense, vibrant green. 
Towering trees, each one larger than the next, stretch toward the sky, their leaves shimmering in shades of emerald and gold. 
Rivers wind like silver threads through the dense foliage, glinting under the sunlight that filters down in dappled patches.

The ship smashes through the upper canopy of trees, tearing through branches before crashing to a jarring halt on the forest floor. 
The impact sends up a spray of soil and vegetation, and the sound of cracking metal echoes through the quiet forest. 
Inside, Jaxon and Teth are thrown against their harnesses, momentarily stunned by the force of the crash.

When the dust settles, they find themselves surrounded by the planet’s alien beauty. 
Enormous plants with bioluminescent blooms cast a soft glow, illuminating the dense underbrush in hues of blue and green. 
The air is thick and humid, filled with the earthy scent of moss and flowering vines. 
Strange calls echo from unseen creatures lurking in the shadows, hinting at life forms both wondrous and potentially dangerous.

Jaxon releases his harness, grimacing as he looks over at Teth.
Jaxon: "Looks like we made it. Now… let’s hope the Ra'kra didn’t follow us down here."

Teth looks through cockpit window, his eyes wide.
Teth: "If they did, they’ll have to get through this jungle first."

Around them, Calyra I pulses with a strange, quiet energy. 
Their ship is battered and bruised, half-buried in the soft soil, but Jaxon and Teth are alive—stranded, perhaps, but ready for whatever awaits them in this wild, untamed world.

The cockpit around you is dim, lit only by the pulsing red light on the console.
You glance back toward the rear ramp. A small medical locker is mounted nearby, its door slightly open, showing medkits and injectors.
Ramp’s mechanism is twisted, jammed from the impact, leaving it unusable. 
Your eyes fall on the emergency hatch. It’s a bit scuffed but still functional.
