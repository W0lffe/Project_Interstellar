PROLOGUE

In the vast emptiness of space, where silence reigns supreme, the remnants of humanity cling to survival amidst the ruins of a once-great civilization. 
After decades of relentless interplanetary wars, the echoes of conflict still resonate across the stars, leaving behind only the battered husks of ships and the debris of shattered alliances. 
Resources, once abundant, have dwindled to near extinction, fueling desperation and despair.

Among the scattered colonies that dot the desolate planets and crumbling space stations, hope is a rare commodity. 
These small enclaves of humanity, isolated from one another, fight to survive against not only the harsh realities of their environments but also a relentless alien race—the Ra'kra. 
Ruthless and cunning, the Ra'kra have decimated entire fleets, their insatiable hunger for conquest driven by an unyielding thirst for power.

Amidst this chaos, one man stands determined to defy the odds: Captain Jaxon Ryker. 
An experienced pilot and a former officer of the once-mighty Terran Space Fleet, Jaxon is haunted not only by memories of glory long past but by the torment of loss. 
His beloved wife, taken captive by the Ra'kra during a brutal raid, has become a phantom of hope that drives him forward. 
Each day that passes without her only deepens his resolve to rescue her from the clutches of their cruel captors.

His mission is clear: to navigate the treacherous waters of a fractured universe, seek out allies among the remnants of humanity, and face the looming threat of the Ra'kra. 
With every flicker of the ship's engines, Jaxon feels the weight of his quest pressing upon him—a quest not just for survival, but for the love he refuses to abandon.

His journey has just begun, and with every star that shines above, he vows to find her, to bring her home, and to restore what was once whole.

S1

You wake with a start, the dim light filtering through the vents barely illuminating your cramped quarters. 
The remnants of the same haunting nightmare still cling to your mind, visions of darkness and loss that you can't shake.

Jaxon (muttering): "I have to find her... I have to find my wife..."

With a sigh, you push yourself up from the thin, worn mattress, feeling the weight of the mission pressing down on you. 
As your eyes adjust, you take in the familiar yet unwelcoming room around you. 

To your left stands a small, dented cabinet—a place where you keep the few essentials you've managed to scavenge or save. 
Nearby, a datapad rests on the makeshift nightstand, its screen faintly glowing as it awaits commands.
Through the thin walls, you can hear the muted sounds of life in the station—a few people talking in hushed voices just outside your dorm.

You come out of the dorm room and look through the big windows. It's a sunny day out here at Veskar Station. 
You notice fleet ships leaving the dock, their engines humming as they ascend into the endless void. 
Next to the windows, you spot your wingmen, Jaxer and Teth, deep in conversation.

Jaxer: "I swear, Teth, the Ra'kra have been getting bolder every day. I heard they almost breached sector nine defenses last night."

Teth nods grimly, his arms crossed. 
Teth: "Yeah, and command's been keeping it quiet. They don’t want the station to panic."

Jaxer turns to you and grins. 
Jaxer: "Ryker! You're up early for once." Teth raises an eyebrow. "Bad dreams again?"

You nod, trying to shake off the remnants of the nightmare.

Jaxer: "Well, at least you're awake now. We could use the extra pair of eyes out there. Rumor has it the Ra'kra scouts have been seen closer to Veskar than ever before."

Teth: "I don't trust those scouts. They're always the start of something bigger."

You glance at the fleet ships preparing to jump into hyperspace. The sight is all too familiar. 
The Ra'kra took everything from you, including the one person you’d give anything to find.

The mission to find your wife is never far from your mind, but for now, duty calls.
Jaxer claps a hand on your shoulder, a grin spreading across his face.
Jaxer:  "Come on, Ryker, let's hit the firing range. I want to see if you've still got that deadly aim."

You feel a surge of determination. The search isn't over, and as long as you’re breathing, there’s still hope.

S2O1

You give a quick nod to Teth and Jaxer, feeling the weight of camaraderie. 
Jaxon: "Alright, let’s see what the range has in store."

The three of you make your way down the narrow corridors of the station, passing other crew members busy with their own routines. 
The hum of machinery fills the hall as you step into the firing range—a place of preparation, focus, and relentless practice. 
As you each take position, the air shifts to a determined silence, broken only by the sound of weapons charging up.

Jaxer grins as he loads his rifle. 
Jaxer: "Time to show you two who is the best shot here."

Jaxon: "Haha, we will see about that."

S201,1

Each target lights up in rapid succession, dead-center marks stacking up. 
You and Teth exchange an amused glance, both shaking their heads as you calmly set down your weapon.

Jaxer laughs, clapping you on the back. 
Jaxer: "Show-off! You know, if you were any more of a sharpshooter, we’d have to start calling you ‘Laser Eyes’."

Teth smirks, crossing his arms. 
Teth: "Face it, Jaxer, we could practice all day and we’d still be one step behind the legend here."

You chuckle, giving them a modest shrug. 
Jaxon: "Just instinct, fellas. But hey, someone’s gotta keep you two on your toes."

Jaxer grins. 
Jaxer: "Lucky for us, we’ve got the best shot on Veskar by our side."

As you walk back through the corridor, the lighthearted banter fades. Around them, the atmosphere has shifted. 
Crew members are exchanging anxious whispers, some casting uneasy glances toward the station’s outer decks.

Teth frowns, noticing the tension. 
Teth: "You guys feel that? It’s like everyone’s holding their breath."

You nod, your senses sharpen. 
Jaxon: "Yeah, something’s up."

A sudden, thunderous explosion rocks the station. The walls tremble, the lights flicker, and an alarm blares through the corridors. 
The overhead speaker crackles with a warning: “All hands, battle stations! The Ra'kra have breached the perimeter!”

The blast sends you sprawling onto the cold metal floor, your ears ringing as alarms blare in the distance. 
Through your blurred vision, you see hulking figures in dark, battle-scarred suits entering the room—the Ra'kra soldiers, moving with ruthless precision. 
Their eyes glow red beneath their helmets as they open fire, striking down crew members who barely have time to react.

You spots Teth on the other side of the room, just as a Ra'kra soldier slams him into the wall, leaving him stunned. 
Your heart races as you see Jaxer draw his sidearm, but a shot hits him before he can fire, and he falls.
You grab your weapon and take cover behind a fallen console.


S2O2

You take a moment for yourself, letting Teth and Jaxer head to the firing range without you. 
The sounds of the bustling station fade as you lean against the wall, closing your eyes. 
The memories come back—the last time you saw her, the look in her eyes before she was taken. 
You feel the familiar ache, the relentless pull to keep searching, to not give up.

After a deep breath, you steady yourself, grounding your focus. There will be time to join the others. 
But for now, you just need this brief silence to remember what you're really fighting for.

A sudden, thunderous explosion rocks the station. The walls tremble, the lights flicker, and an alarm blares through the corridors. 
The overhead speaker crackles with a warning: “All hands, battle stations! The Ra'kra have breached the perimeter!”

The blast sends you sprawling onto the cold metal floor, your ears ringing as alarms blare in the distance. 
Through your blurred vision, you see hulking figures in dark, battle-scarred suits entering the room—the Ra'kra soldiers, moving with ruthless precision. 
Their eyes glow red beneath their helmets as they open fire, striking down crew members who barely have time to react.
